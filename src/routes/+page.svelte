		<h2>Raising Awareness About Climate Change</h2>
	</header>

<article> 
	Climate change, an issue of grave concern, is primarily driven by the escalating levels of greenhouse gas emissions that envelop our planet. These emissions, primarily composed of carbon dioxide, methane, and other industrial gases, act like a blanket, trapping the sun's heat within the Earth's atmosphere instead of allowing it to radiate back into space. This phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, is the main driver of global warming, which in turn catalyzes the broader changes in climate patterns that we collectively refer to as climate change. The consequences of these changes are far-reaching and potentially catastrophic, affecting every aspect of our lives from weather patterns to food production and biodiversity. Alarmingly, the rate at which our world is warming is unprecedented in recorded history, with recent decades witnessing a rapid and consistent increase in global temperatures. This accelerated warming trend underscores the urgency of addressing climate change and the necessity of implementing sustainable practices to mitigate its impacts.
